<p>Anyone who has used C, C++, or any other &ldquo;native&rdquo; language is probably familiar
with the idea that you have a compiler which takes your source code and turns it
into a native binary which the system can execute.. but what does that actually
mean? What is a native binary? If I compile a simple <em>Hello, World!</em> program in
C, the resulting native binary is over 16KB. Surely it doesn&rsquo;t take 16KB of
machine code to print Hello World, so why is it so big? Lets take a closer look.</p>

<h2>Execution Environment</h2>

<p>First, lets consider what we get from our execution environment. Most &ldquo;native&rdquo;
applications are built for a specific Operating System (the C standard calls
this a &ldquo;hosted&rdquo; environment). The OS provides us with a mechanism for starting
our native application, and interfaces that allow the application to interact
with the outside world (e.g. filesystem access, stdin, stdout, but also more
primitive things such as the ability to request more RAM for the application).
Since one OS might provide a different interface from another OS, native
applications are not necessarily portable between different operating systems.
We will look at what happens in a Linux environment, but many of the details
will be similar for other OSes.</p>

<p>One of the most significant things provided by modern architectures is <em>virtual
memory</em>.  This allows every application to run with an <em>independent address
space</em>. What this means is that two applications can both have a variable at the
same virtual address without interfering with each other. Behind the scenes, the
OS will map these virtual addresses to different physical addresses. One of the
main benefits of virtual memory is that applications are shielded from each
other by default: a rogue process cannot stomp all over the memory of another
process when it goes wrong.</p>

<p>The very first thing which we will want to do with our application is start it.
There are a few things that need to happen here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The OS needs to open the application file, figure out what it is, and decide
how to run it. Remember that not all executable files are native
applications: a script with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">shebang</a> can be marked executable
and Linux will delegate to the appropriate interpreter to run it.</li>
<li>Memory needs to be allocated for the stack, and for all global variables.</li>
<li>Code and data (e.g. the values for constants, the initial value for global
variables) needs to be copied<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> into this memory.</li>
<li>Any environment inputs (such as <code>envp</code>, <code>argc</code>, <code>argv</code>) have to be copied
into memory.</li>
<li>Finally, the processor has to jump to the <em>entry point</em> of our program to
begin executing it.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)</h2>

<p>In Linux, native executable files are stored in ELF files. An ELF file has a few
main components:</p>

<ul>
<li>The magic number 0x464c457F (which is &ldquo;\x7FELF&rdquo; in ASCII), which must appear
at the start of the file.</li>
<li>A file header, which tells us where to find various other things and how to
interpret them.</li>
<li>A number of section headers, each describing a section.</li>
<li>A number of program headers, each describing a program segment.</li>
<li>The stuff we actually wrote: the data and the code.</li>
</ul>


<p>Below is a diagram of the logical layout of an ELF file. The sections below will
elaborate on this layout.</p>

<p><img src="elf.png" alt="ELF" /></p>

<h3>ELF File Header</h3>

<p>The file header is responsible for configuring some basic options: what
architecture the binary is intended for, whether the file format is 32-bit or
64-bit, some version fields which specify the ELF version to use, and various
other things. The file header also specifies where to find the program header
table and the section header table, and how many entries we should expect to
find in each. However, probably the most significant field in the file header is
the <em>entry point</em>: this is the address in memory that the OS should jump to at
the very start of program execution, just after everything has been loaded into
the right place.</p>

<h3>ELF Section Header Table</h3>

<p>The Section Header Table consists of an array of Section Header Entries. Each
entry defines a single section. You may have heard of some sections before:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.text</code> contains the executable machine code.</li>
<li><code>.rodata</code> contains read-only data.</li>
<li><code>.data</code> contains mutable data which has a non-zero initial value.</li>
<li><code>.bss</code> contains mutable data which is initially zero.</li>
</ul>


<p>Section names are completely arbitrary: the above names are only used by
convention. You could easily make a program which had everything in a section
called <code>.rick_astley</code> if you wanted to mess with someone. In fact, the section
names themselves are stored as plain data in a specific section, conventionally
known as <code>.shstrtab</code>. Even this section need not have a name: it is identified
by its index.</p>

<p>Sections are primarily useful for development purposes: intermediate files
during compilation can also stored using the ELF file format and will make heavy
use of sections to organise different components of the program before they are
finally put together by the linker. Additionally, sections may contain metadata
such as function names and their corresponding machine code addresses to
facilitate debugging.</p>

<p>While the above sections are present in almost <em>every</em> ELF executable, a minimal
binary does not actually need <em>any</em> sections at all. Everything we need to know
for program execution can be expressed using the Program Header Table. If we are
striving for smaller binaries (or even trying to obfuscate our binaries against
nosy programmers), we can completely strip out all of the sections.</p>

<h3>ELF Program Header Table</h3>

<p>The Program Header Table consists of an array of Program Header Entries. Each
entry defines a single <em>program segment</em>. There are multiple kinds of segment,
but the main one we are interested in here is <code>PT_LOAD</code>, which defines a segment
that the OS should load into memory before starting the application. For each
segment, we specify:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where to find the contents of the segment in the file.</li>
<li>How much data we expect to find in the file.</li>
<li>Where (in virtual memory) the segment should be loaded before entry.</li>
<li>How large the program segment should be in memory. This value can be larger
than the file size, in which case the segment in memory will have additional
space available for the application to use. All bytes in the additional
space will be initialized to 0. This feature is especially useful for the
<code>.bss</code> segment, which only contains 0-valued variables. We can use this
feature to initialize many such variables without increasing the size of our
binary file.</li>
<li>The permission bits for the segment. When we load the segments into memory,
we have the opportunity to define how that memory may be used: whether it
can be read as data, whether it can be written to, and whether it can be
executed. Generally, code will be loaded as read-only and executable, while
data will be loaded as read-write but not executable. This reduces the
potential blast radius of programmer errors by causing the application to
get a segmentation fault when the access invariants are violated, instead of
allowing the violation to potentially go undetected for an extended period
while the application behaviour slowly descends into chaos.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Entry Point</h3>

<p>Finally, we get to the entry point of the program. This is the first place where
we can execute arbitrary code of our own, and is conventionally called <code>_start</code>.
The entry point of the program is <strong>not</strong> a function. We have no return address
on the stack, so we cannot return.  We also may not have the stack aligned
appropriately for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI</a> we are following, so we may have to do that
ourselves as well. The OS has provided us with the memory that we requested, as
well as a stack. However, before we can really do anything productive we need to
build a mental model of the memory layout.</p>

<p><img src="memory.png" alt="Memory Layout" /></p>

<p>Part of this layout is given to us by default: the OS reserves the Kernel space,
so there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about that. The environment variables, arguments,
and stack are all set up by default in ELF, so we&rsquo;ll get those without asking.
However, the rest of the layout is followed only by convention: we have complete
control over the placement of our program segments in ELF, so we can place our
code and global variables wherever we want. We don&rsquo;t have to have a heap if we
don&rsquo;t need one: after all, the heap is simply a data structure that uses system
calls to ask for more virtual memory addresses to be assigned to physical
memory. The normal interface for loading dynamic libraries, <code>dlopen</code>, does not
give us the flexibility to pick where the library is loaded, so we have to
follow that convention unless we want to write our own loader.</p>

<p>Now we can finally look at our entry point in earnest. When the OS has finished
setting up the memory layout that we described in our ELF file, it will jump to
the given entry point. At that time, the stack pointer will be pointing at
<code>argc</code> and will have an unspecified alignment. In 64-bit linux, the ABI calling
convention for linux is <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/System_V_ABI">System V</a>. In 32-bit linux, the convention is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#cdecl">cdecl</a>, although there are many alternatives. In both cases, a function
call will push the return address onto to the top of the stack (which, since the
stack grows downwards, has the lowest address). Now we can see why <code>_start</code> is
not a function: there&rsquo;s no return address on the stack.</p>

<p>Generally, <code>_start</code> is responsible for invoking global initializers (e.g.
constructors for global variables), calling <code>main</code>, and then exiting with a code
based on the return value from <code>main</code>. In order for us to call <code>main</code>, we need
to follow the appropriate calling convention, which means aligning the stack
appropriately (16-byte alignment, generally), putting the right values for
<code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> into the appropriate places (the stack in cdecl, certain
registers in System V), and then executing <code>call main</code> to enter our familiar
territory.</p>

<h2>Tiny ELF Binaries</h2>

<p>Now that we know what we can find inside an ELF binary, how can we make it as
small and fast as possible? A great article on the subject is <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ricko/CSE131/teensyELF.htm">A Whirlwind
Tutorial on Creating Really Teensy ELF Executables for Linux</a>, but
that goes well beyond what most people will be willing to do for real projects,
so lets focus on what we have learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>ELF binaries are required to have a file header, at least one program
segment, and the code which we want to run. Technically these sections can
overlap in sneaky ways to reduce the overall size, but for simplicity we
will assume that they cannot and will lay them out in a disjoint fashion.</li>
<li>ELF binaries can be 32-bit or 64-bit. A minimal 64-bit ELF binary is
necessarily bigger than a minimal 32-bit ELF binary since the header field
sizes will double in size. Additionally, pointers in our machine code will
be twice as large in 64-bit mode which can further increase our binary size.</li>
<li>By default, we will get a bunch of additional stuff: multiple program
segments with different access permissions (for safety), many sections
containing function names and lookup tables (for debugging convenience), and
lots of zeroes (for aligning program segments on page boundaries).</li>
<li>We get some overhead from the dynamic linker code. If we are not using many
functions from a given library, the size of the dynamic linking overhead may
exceed the size of the inlined functions that we need.</li>
</ul>


<p>Given this, we will aim to make a minimal ELF setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>32-bit instead of 64-bit. The 32-bit calling convention is less efficient
than the 64-bit one since we must use the stack, but many functions can be
inlined which will avoid that overhead, and by limiting ourselves to 32-bit
we eliminate the overhead that comes from the larger addresses.</li>
<li>A single program segment. We are throwing away some safety features by doing
this: our single program segment will be read-write <em>and</em> executable, which
can expose us to some nasty security vulnerabilities if we are not careful,
but we will save at least 32 bytes for each program segment that we remove.</li>
<li>No sections whatsoever. By discarding these, it becomes much harder to debug
our code using <code>objdump</code> or <code>gdb</code>, but we can always rebuild our binaries in
the normal fashion to reproduce issues in a better debugging environment.</li>
<li>Minimal alignment: we will pack all of our code and data tightly together,
only aligning them to 4-byte boundaries.</li>
</ul>


<p>Without further ado, here&rsquo;s the recipe:</p>

<p><strong>Makefile</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>CC = gcc -m32
LD = ld -m elf_i386

# Optimize for size and disable debugging features.
CFLAGS += -Os -DNDEBUG

# Omitting frame pointers can reduce the size of functions by eliminating
# the need to store the stack pointer upon entry. This is again mostly
# useful for generating stack traces or debugging.
CFLAGS += -fomit-frame-pointer

# Place all functions and variables in separate sections and instruct the
# linker to discard unused sections. This will automatically prune any data
# or code which we are not actually using.
CFLAGS += -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections
LDFLAGS += --gc-sections

# Disable the standard library and default start files: we'll write our own
# I/O routines and provide our own _start. Also, auto-include our bootstrap
# code.
CFLAGS += -nostdlib -nostartfiles -include start.h

# Disable position-independent code. This is necessary for our custom linker
# script to work properly.
CFLAGS += -fno-pic

# Build the binary and strip *all* sections. GNU strip doesn't have this
# option and will always leave behind section names, so we are using
# llvm-strip.
app: app.o link.ld
    ${LD} ${LDFLAGS} -T link.ld app.o -o app
    llvm-strip --strip-sections app

# Compile our C program.
app.o: app.c start.h
    ${CC} ${CFLAGS} -c app.c -o app.o

<p><strong>start.h</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>app.c</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>int main() {
  write(STDOUT_FILENO, "Hello, World!\n", 14);

<p>After all this work, what have we achieved?</p>

<pre><code>$ make
...
$ gcc -include unistd.h -Os -s app.c -o app-big
$ ls -l app app-big
-rwxr-xr-x 1 joe joe   131 Jan 19 19:20 app
-rwxr-xr-x 1 joe joe 14328 Jan 19 19:22 app-big
</code></pre>

<p>Aside from the <code>-include unistd.h</code> which replaces our <code>start.h</code> with the normal
definitions for each syscall, the command to build <code>app-big</code> is what I would
normally write when compiling a simple program. Yet, with ~50 lines of code
spread between <code>Makefile</code>, <code>link.ld</code>, and <code>start.h</code>, we can get a binary which
is <em>literally 100x smaller</em>!</p>

<p>From now on, I might spend a little more time shaving off the unnecessary bytes
for my projects :)</p>

Strictly, not all data needs to be copied from the file into memory
every time the application is started. Read-only parts of an application
(such as code or constant data) will always be the same in every instance of
the application, so we can share a single copy between many running
instances to save resources. Through paging and the filesystem cache, we can
even run applications that have far more code or data than the total
available RAM of our system, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another day.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></li>
