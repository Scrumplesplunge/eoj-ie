<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Joe.</p>

<p><img src="me.jpg" alt="Me" /></p>

<p>When I was 7, I started learning Karate; when I was 12, guitar; and when I was
13, I started learning to program. Today, as I write this, I have a first dan
black belt in Shotokai Karate, I can fingerpick my way through Nothing Else
Matters by Metallica (amongst other things), and I have written thousands of
lines of code in a handful of different programming languages, achieving
hundreds of different objectives*. I live in Dublin, and work at Google as
a Software Engineer in Site Reliability Engineering.</p>

<p>If someone were to ask me to describe myself with a single word, I would
probably choose the word <em>programmer</em>. People often glaze over when I bring up
programming. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve suddenly started speaking in a completely different
language, often despite my efforts to explain things in elementary terms.</p>

<p>I spend a large amount of my personal time writing code. Sometimes it is code
which will make my life easier, but more often than not it is something
I thought would be fun to make, or fun to use. This while site exists mostly so
that I have somewhere to put descriptions, demos, or screenshots of my projects.
If you have known me for a long time, chances are I have sent you something like
this.</p>

<p>Perhaps one day I will get bored of programming, but for now you will have to
put up with it.</p>

<p>* These objectives have varied in complexity from large and intricate projects
like <a href="https://github.com/Scrumplesplunge/raytracer">raytracers</a> down to silly scripts for <a href="/5">replacing every word on facebook
with HORSE</a>.</p>
