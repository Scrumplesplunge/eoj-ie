Hi, I'm Joe.

![Me](me.jpg)

When I was 7, I started learning Karate; when I was 12, guitar; and when I was
13, I started learning to program. Today, as I write this, I have a first dan
black belt in Shotokai Karate, I can fingerpick my way through Nothing Else
Matters by Metallica (amongst other things), and I have written thousands of
lines of code in a handful of different programming languages, achieving
hundreds of different objectives\*. I live in Dublin, and work at Google as
a Software Engineer in Site Reliability Engineering.

If someone were to ask me to describe myself with a single word, I would
probably choose the word *programmer*. People often glaze over when I bring up
programming. It's like I've suddenly started speaking in a completely different
language, often despite my efforts to explain things in elementary terms.

I spend a large amount of my personal time writing code. Sometimes it is code
which will make my life easier, but more often than not it is something
I thought would be fun to make, or fun to use. This while site exists mostly so
that I have somewhere to put descriptions, demos, or screenshots of my projects.
If you have known me for a long time, chances are I have sent you something like
this.

Perhaps one day I will get bored of programming, but for now you will have to
put up with it.

\* These objectives have varied in complexity from large and intricate projects
like [raytracers][1] down to silly scripts for [replacing every word on facebook
with HORSE][2].
