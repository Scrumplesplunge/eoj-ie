Today I fished out a few of my old web projects and thought they were
interesting enough to share. Most of these date back to around 2010-2012.
I can't guarantee that any of them will work well, and I don't intend to modify
them. Check them out at your peril :)

The ones I think are most interesting and/or fun:

  * [2D Combat AI](/games/ai)
  * [Custom 3D Rendering](3d)
  * [Christmas Raytracer](christmas)

Games:

  * [Connect 4](/games/connect4)
  * Noughts and Crosses:
    [Pretty Multiplayer](/games/noughts-and-crosses/two-player.html),
    [Ugly Singleplayer](/games/noughts-and-crosses/one-player.html)
  * [Gravity](/games/gravity)
  * [Physics Sandbox](/games/physics)

Demos:

  * [A Bezier Curve Renderer](bezier)
  * [A JavaScript Console](console) (from before there were Developer Tools!)
  * [Towers of Hanoi Solver](hanoi)
  * [A 3D Globe.. thing](icosphere)
