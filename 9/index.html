<p>This weekend I took part in <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39">Ludum Dare 39</a>. The theme was <em>Running Out Of
Power</em>, so I decided to make a sidescroller with a draining health bar and some
puzzles to complete.</p>

<p><a href="/games/quest"><img src="quest.png" alt="Game Preview" /></a></p>

<p>Click the picture to try out the game.</p>

<p>This is the first time I have ever written a side-scroller. Usually I stick with
top-down games because I never wanted to try and deal with the fiddly physics
stuff necessary to make controls work. However, it turned out much better than
I was expecting. I was able to implement a simple physics engine which could
determine whether the player was on the ground, use this information to change
the character sprites appropriately, and even make a simple level editing tool
to speed up the process of applying the scenery mesh to the background image.</p>

<h1>Plot</h1>

<p>The plot is pretty generic. You are a wizard who has been cursed by Wizardy
McVillainFace. The curse is slowly draining your power, and you must traverse
a bunch of levels in search of a cure for your affliction.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that this plot would&rsquo;ve held a lot more significance if I had time to
actually put the cure, or a final encounter with Wizardy McVillainFace into the
game.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I really felt like I could have added a lot more to this game. The biggest thing
reported in the comments from reviewers was that it needed more levels, and
I completely agree. I only had time to make two. If I had been given more time,
this would have been the first thing that I would have dealt with. Beyond that,
this game has no sound effects. I feel like the sound effects in <a href="/games/defend-the-earth">my previous
game</a> were a big part of what made it fun.</p>
