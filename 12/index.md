It was Ludum Dare again this weekend, this time with the theme *Combine
2 Incompatible Genres*. I chose to mix Solitaire with a Dungeon Crawler.

Click the picture to try the game. Alternatively, you can try the [compo

within the competition time limit.

If you get stuck, try reading through the README file on the code page linked
below.
