<p>I recently discovered <a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=719">Gynvael&rsquo;s Summer GameDev Challenge</a>, which has
a fairly tight limit on the total size for game submissions: 64KiB, all-in.
Submissions are advised to use JavaScript or WebAssembly, but as far as I was
aware Emscripten produces a fair amount of boilerplate in JavaScript to make the
wasm experience painless. I found out that <code>clang</code> natively supports compiling
to webassembly without any help from Emscripten, so I decided to see if I could
get it working. The result is a trivial helloworld example using WebAssembly
without Emscripten.</p>

<p>To start with, we&rsquo;ll look at the C code:</p>

<pre><code>// write is imported from js.
void write(const char* message, int length);

// We have no standard library access, so we need to provide our own strlen
// and puts.
unsigned long strlen(const char* c_string) {
  const char* i = c_string;
  while (*i) i++;
  return i - c_string;
}

void puts(const char* message) {
  write(message, strlen(message));
}

// We need to export symbols for them to be accessible in JavaScript. This
// attribute is how we tell clang to export the symbol from the WebAssembly
// module.
#define export __attribute__((visibility("default")))

export int main() {
  puts("Hello, World!\n");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we need to turn this into a WebAssembly module. Here is the Makefile:</p>

<pre><code># clang is natively a cross compiler, yay! You might need to install wasm-ld,
# though. On ArchLinux, that just required `pacman -S lld`.
CC = clang --target=wasm32

# The standard library probably won't work out of the box, so we'll disable it.
CFLAGS = -nostdlib

# --no-entry              Prevents issues due to there being no _start. We'll
#                         just call main directly.
# --export-dynamic        This works alongside the export macro in the code to
#                         ensure that our exported functions are exposed in the
#                         WebAssembly.
# --import-memory         This makes the module expect a "memory" import which
#                         has the initial linear memory for the module.
# --allow-undefined-file  This is a file containing the names of every function
#                         which the compiler should allow to be undefined in the
#                         compiled WebAssembly module. These will have to be
#                         defined in JavaScript instead. Oddly, this seems to
#                         interact weirdly with -flto: enabling -flto makes
#                         things compile with undefined symbols even if they are
#                         not listed in this file.
LDFLAGS = -Wl,--no-entry -Wl,--export-dynamic -Wl,--import-memory  \
                    -Wl,--allow-undefined-file=jsimport.txt

hello.wasm: hello.c
    ${CC} ${CFLAGS} ${LDFLAGS} $^ -o $@
</code></pre>

<p>With this, we can build a binary blob <code>hello.wasm</code>. We can make this much
smaller by adding the various optimization flags but I omitted those for
brevity. The final step is to load this module in JavaScript. I was expecting
this to be much harder than it actually is, and was pleasantly surprised with
what it actually took:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;meta charset=utf-8&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
// WebAssembly memory is allocated in 64KiB chunks, so 2 means 128KiB.
const memory = new WebAssembly.Memory({initial: 2});

// This is the write() function we are using in the C code. Pointers get passed
// to javascript as offsets into the memory ArrayBuffer.
function write(message, length) {
  const value = new Uint8Array(memory.buffer, message, length);
  console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(value));
}

// The second argument to instantiateStreaming is how we provide the
// dependencies (imports) of the WebAssembly module. The compiler flags we used
// mean that we have to provide the initial memory, and we are using the
// undefined function write, so we need to provide its definition. If you forget
// to provide something which the module needs, it will fail to instantiate. You
// can enumerate all the dependencies for a WebAssembly module with:
//
// const module = WebAssembly.compileStreaming(fetch('hello.wasm'));
// for (const {kind, module, name} of WebAssembly.Module.imports(module)) {
//   console.log("%s %s::%s", kind, module, name);
// }
//
// Here, kind is "function", "table", "memory", or "global". We will need to set
// importObject[module][name] to something to satisfy the requirement. In our
// case, we have env::memory and env::write which we need to provide.
//
// After instantiating the module, the promise yields an object through which we
// can access the exported symbols of the module via o.instance.exports.foo. We
// will just invoke the main() function.
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch('hello.wasm'), {env: {memory, write}})
           .then(o =&gt; o.instance.exports.main());
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Altogether, with various compiler optimizations enabled and all the HTML
minified, the hello world program is only 517 bytes.</p>
